		<p> After hearing the suspension of the former NFL player Ray Rice for the assault on his fiancee she saw the video 
		of him actually punching Janay Rice and it reminded her of her past.She was carried out of her finace's apartment 
		and into a car after being beaten by him.She was told by her fiancee that she had bounced off the walls however,at
		that time she was engaged to him but living with her mother but wasn't able to go back since she didn't want to 
		explain what had happened to her."I was embarassed to tell my own mother what he had done to me I even blamed myself
		for this what had happened.I later learned that it was not my fault but my mistake for not leaving him when he first
		raised his hand at me." She later divoreced him and she has been working on behalf of women, children and families
		facing through domestic violence for 20 years now.
